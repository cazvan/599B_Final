Introduction and Data Summary
</b></p>

**Introduction**

The Affordable Care Act (ACA or “Obamacare”) was signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010. A major overhaul of the U.S. health-care system, Obamacare aimed to reduce the amount of uncompensated care the average U.S. family pays for by requiring everyone to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.

Our analysis tries to find out what were the effects of the ACA expansion or no expansion on the average mental health of Americans.

Our dataset is comprised two sets merged together. The first, Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) surveys from 2000 to 2017 were created by the U.S. Center for Disease Control (CDC) and downloaded from their website: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_data.htm. We used the following variables: 

* mental 
* stab 
* ex2014
* ex2016
* sex
* year

The outcome variable that concerns this report is labeled 'mental.' On each survey, respondants were asked how many days out of the last 30 they felt negative mental health effects, including anxiety, depression, or stress. Though this variable is subjective, this report uses it as a stand-in to capture numerically the general mental health states of those surveyed.

The variable labeled stab refers to state name abbreviations. The variable ex2014 is a binary variable for whether or not a state expanded under the Affordable Care Act in 2014; similarly, ex2016 is a binary variable for whether or not a state expanded under the Affordable Care Act in 2016. Sex captures the biological sex of the respondant, and year captures the year of the survey.

The second dataset was a handmade dataset dataset consisteing of each state in the U.S. and the year the state expanded under the Affordable Care Act. The first task was to import the whole dataset (~250mb), then remove the unused variables. We then saved the variables we needed into two smaller datasets, both under 100mb, so that we could upload them to GitHub.

**Research Question**

<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 130%;"><b>
Are there any differences in terms of mental health between the states that expanded ACA and those that did not? If so, what are the effects of the expansion/no expansion on the individuals? (males vs females)

Data Pre-processing
</b></p>

First we need call the libraries in order to use the packages
<<<<<<< HEAD

```{r,libraries, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
=======
```{r, libraries, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, message=FALSE}
# call libraries:
>>>>>>> parent of 5752783... Update
library(ggplot2)
library(haven)
library(Rmisc)
library(ggpubr)
library(tibble)
library(ggrepel)
library(magrittr)
library(dplyr)
library(reshape2)
library(Hmisc)
library(dotwhisker)
library(broom)
library(pscl)
library(MASS)
library(boot)
library(cowplot)
```

This chunk imports the original data file that was stored in dropbox:

```{r, loaddata, eval=FALSE}
# datalink='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/rpjq0x1bgzgdvh1/BRFSS599B.dta'
# brfssdata_orig=read_dta(datalink)
```

The chunk below trims unused variables from the dataframe. Because the original data file was 250mb, we need to trim it so it can be uploaded to GitHub. This chunk trims the data file and saves a csv in the working directory:

```{r loaddata3, eval=FALSE}
# brfssdata=brfssdata_orig%>% # make a new list from the original dataset
#    select(mental, stab, ex2014,ex2016, year)%>% # select the 5 variables we need for plots
#    filter(!is.na(stab))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter(!is.na(mental))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter(!is.na(year))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter(!is.na(ex2014))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter(!is.na(ex2016))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter((year!=2018)) # filter responses from 2018 (it's a tiny sample and has weird averages)
# write.csv(brfssdata,"brfss.csv",row.names = FALSE) # write the list into a csv
# head(brfssdata) # look at the column names
# dim(brfssdata) # look at the dimensions
# brfssdata = read.csv("brfss.csv") # read back into RStudio if necessary
```

This chunk also trims the original datafile into a smaller file, but saves different variables that are used in the multivariate plot:

```{r loaddata2, eval=FALSE }
# brfssdata2=brfssdata_orig%>% # create a second list from the original dataset, with different variables
#    select(mental, stab, ex2014,sex, year)%>% # select the 5 variables we need for plots
#    filter(!is.na(stab))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter(!is.na(mental))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter(!is.na(year))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter(!is.na(ex2014))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter(!is.na(sex))%>% # filter out n/a responses
#    filter((year!=2018)) # filter responses from 2018 (it's a tiny sample and has weird averages)
# write.csv(brfssdata2,"brfss2.csv",row.names = FALSE) # write the list to csv
# head(brfssdata2) # look at the column names
# dim(brfssdata2) # look at the dimensions
# brfssdata2 = read.csv("brfss2.csv") #
```

Then we need to load the data we are going to use for our analysis by importing the datasets we just made (~90mb each). This chunk imports the csv files that the previous two chunks uploaded to Github. Because these files are under 100mb, they were able to be uploaded:

```{r}
brfssdata=read.csv("https://github.com/cazvan/599B_Final/raw/master/brfss.csv")
brfssdata2=read.csv("https://github.com/cazvan/599B_Final/raw/master/brfss2.csv")
```

This chunk removes states that do not fit neatly into the categories we use in our plots. These four states expanded ACA after 2014 ("AK" "LA" "MT" "PA") and are excluded from the results:
```{r}
brfssdata$stab=as.character(brfssdata$stab) #convert stab into numeric
bad=unique(brfssdata$stab[(brfssdata$ex2014 == 0 & brfssdata$ex2016 == 1)]) #create a list of the bad states
bad # show us the bad states
```

Data prep for visualization: Calculate annual average negative mental days, grouped into expansion and non-expansion states
```{r}

What is the survey count by year? 
</b></p>

We start our analysis by looking at the overall number of surveys over the year 2000-2018. This provides more information on the size and depth of our data for conducting analysis.  
```{r}
#Univariate Visualization: barplot
source1="BRFSS Survey Data 2000-2018" #source
titlecount="Survey Count by Year" #title for the plot

yearplot=ggplot(data= brfssdata, aes(x=year)) + # create the yearplot object using the main dataset
  geom_bar(stat = "count", fill="steelblue") + # make the yearplot into a barplot, color it
  labs(title=titlecount, x=NULL, y=NULL,caption=source1) + # use the labels created above
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) + # set the scale for the y axis
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(2000:2017)) + # set the scale for the years on the x axis
  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white",colour = "grey50"), # choose background colors
                              plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0), # default was 1 #set caption position 
                              plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), # set title position
                              axis.text.x = element_text(angle = -30, hjust = 0)) # adjust the x axis labels
yearplot # display the year plot
```

The following line plot shows the overall effect of ACA expansion.  With an average of 3.44 days reported with negative mental health, we've witnessed a significant decrease for negative mental health in year 2002 and year 2014. After the ACA expansion in 2014, there is also a significant increase for negative mental health.

Is there any difference for states that expanded ACA verse those states that did not expand?

The next plot shows that people living in the states that expanded ACA experienced more negative mental health than those living in the states that didn't expand ACA. However, after year 2014, there is a more significant increase for states that did not expand ACA.

What are the effects of the ACA expansion on males versus females?
</b></p>

We broke the analysis further down to examine the effects of ACA expansion on male and female respondents. Evidently, ACA expansion had similar effects on both groups in ACA and non-ACA states, i.e. both groups experienced deteriorating mental health from that point onward. Moreover, the analysis shows an interesting result: on average, female respondents experienced more negative mental health days compared to their male counterparts for 18 years.

What are the effects of explanatory variables on average mental health?

Explanation

**Regression Analysis-Logit Model**


```{r}
#starting with a simple model, adding independent variables and tidying along the way

#1
reg1=lm(as.numeric(mental)~year,data=brfssdata2) 
regression1 = tidy(reg1) %>%
    mutate(model = "Model 1") 
#2
reg2=lm(as.numeric(mental)~year+ex2014,data=brfssdata2)
regression2=tidy(reg2) %>% 
    mutate(model = "Model 2")
#3
reg3=lm(as.numeric(mental)~year+ex2014+sex,data=brfssdata2)
regression3=tidy(reg3) %>% 
    mutate(model = "Model 3")
#4
reg4=lm(as.numeric(mental)~year+ex2014+sex+job,data=brfssdata2)
regression4=tidy(reg4) %>% 
    mutate(model = "Model 4")

#let's see the results
summary(reg4)
```


We assume that the nature of our outcome variable (mental) requires more complex model than a linear regression. We attempted conducting the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial regression. We attempted a simple analysis. Due to our lack of familiarity with this model, we had to limit our analysis to these few lines. 

```{r}
zigb <- zeroinfl(mental ~ year + ex2014 + sex, data = brfssdata2)
summary(zigb)
```

```{r}
zigb1 = tidy(zigb) %>%
    mutate(model = "zigb1") 
```

```{r}
dwplot(zigb1)
```

**Comparing Models**


```{r}
allmodels=rbind(regression1,regression2,regression3,regression4)
dwplot(allmodels, vline = geom_vline(xintercept = 0, colour = "grey50", linetype = 2,alpha=0.6)) + 
  xlab("Coefficient Estimates") + 
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Estimation of Coefficents for All Models") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_text(size=10, angle = 0),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size=10),
        plot.title = element_text(size = 12, hjust = 0.5),
        plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 1, vjust = -1.2),
        axis.title.y = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, vjust = 1.75),
        axis.title.x = element_text(size = 11, hjust = 0.5, vjust = -1.25)+
